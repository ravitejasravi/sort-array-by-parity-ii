# sort-array-by-parity-ii

Given an array of integers nums, half of the integers in nums are odd, and the other half are even.<br>
Sort the array so that whenever nums[i] is odd, i is odd, and whenever nums[i] is even, i is even.<br>
Return any answer array that satisfies this condition.<br>

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]<br>
Output: [4,5,2,7]<br>
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.<br>

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,3]<br>
Output: [2,3]<br>
